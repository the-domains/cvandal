After the day is done

The hours between relief and sleep

I count my money

Disconnect from the job

And fall into a heap

Become a sheep

My ambition is in first gear

RPMs in the red

My vehicle is in the desert

Lost to the land

Drowning in sand

So I build my mansion from atmos

It's just a lack of lack in vapor form

And so I live in nothing

But I have the perfect roof to view

The moon cross over the sea

I'm the worst kind of werewolf

The kind that hates both forms

What's the point of being wild

Feeling all the body provides

If it's something to hide

Half the time

I'm sick of part-time living

The constant rise to zero

Sure I say I'm doing good in the world

I'm on the path to someday be great

I desperately want to believe that's true

But if things stay this way, it ain't
