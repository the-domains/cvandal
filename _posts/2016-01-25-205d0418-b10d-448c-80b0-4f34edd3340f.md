The clawing is of the highest caliber. The weapons systems of the Great Gatsby have not declined in recent years. Only the frail failure of furrowed brows can handle the meek mustache of the hindered Hindenburg. Forsooth! Why then did you also take and blame and then trash the trail of the frail and baleful. Buster Keaton is the man for blacks. Borrow and steal guns and then fire them into the fire of hate and death. Because disease is so unpolitical, we must assume then that politicians are parasites sucked in the sight of the blind. Wither the trees until they melt and only after will you find the molten jello of the glass volcano.
